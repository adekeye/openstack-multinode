# deployment. The IP addressing requirements of this network depend
# on the OpenStack Networking plug-in in use and the network
# configuration choices of the virtual networks made by the tenant.
# This network is considered the Guest Security Domain.

# External network - Used to provide VMs with Internet access in some

# addresses:
# - Combined: Where all three endpoints share the same IP address
# - Separate: Where the external URL is assigned to an IP address that
